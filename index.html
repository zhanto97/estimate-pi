            Estimating \( \pi \) with Monte Carlo method
        </h1>
        <p>
            Suppose there is a square of side length \(2r\) and a circle of 
            radius \(r\) inscribed in this square.
            Now, the main idea is to generate a random sample of points on 
            this square and count the number of points that happen to be lying inside the circle.<br>

            $$\text{The area of circle: } \pi r^2 \;\; \text{The area of square: } 2r*2r = 4r^2$$
            $$ \frac{\text{area of circle}}{\text{area of square}} \approx \frac{\text{number of points inside circle}}{\text{total number of points}} $$

            for very large sample. It follows that we can approximate \( \pi \) as
            $$ \pi \approx 4*\frac{\text{number of points inside circle}}{\text{total number of points}} $$

            Let's see this in action!
